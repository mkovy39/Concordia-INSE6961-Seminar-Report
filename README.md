## Project Title
**Ethical Hacking with Metasploit: Exploit & Post Exploit**

This repository contains my individual project report and related files for **INSE6961: Graduate Seminar**, focused on exploring ethical hacking techniques using Metasploit. The project demonstrates the use of Metasploit and other tools to conduct penetration testing, vulnerability exploitation, and post-exploitation tasks.

---

## Project Overview

This project dives into the practical aspects of ethical hacking, emphasizing the use of the Metasploit framework for exploit and post-exploit activities. It covers a wide range of topics, including:

1. Setting up a secure virtualized lab environment.
2. Conducting vulnerability scans and exploitations.
3. Implementing advanced post-exploitation techniques.
4. Using Metasploit modules for password cracking and data collection.

The project serves as an introductory guide for beginners to understand the methodologies and tools used in penetration testing.

## Objectives

1. **Set up** a virtual lab with tools like Kali Linux and Metasploitable.
2. **Learn and apply** vulnerability scanning techniques using Nessus.
3. **Conduct exploits** with Metasploit to compromise vulnerable systems.
4. **Implement post-exploitation tasks** for persistence and sensitive data collection.
5. **Demonstrate advanced hacking techniques** such as Pass the Hash.

## Topics Covered

1. **Setting Up the Laboratory**: 
   - Creation of virtual machines for Kali Linux, Metasploitable, and Windows.
   - Use of VMware Fusion for virtualization.
   - Secure isolation and configuration of the lab environment.

2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: 
   - Introduction to Nessus and its installation on Kali Linux.
   - Configuring and running vulnerability scans on target machines.

3. **Exploitation in Ethical Hacking**: 
   - Exploiting known vulnerabilities using Metasploit.
   - Manual and automated exploitation techniques.

4. **Post-Exploitation and Persistence**:
   - Tasks such as maintaining access, gathering sensitive data, and removing traces.
   - Tools like Meterpreter for advanced post-exploitation capabilities.

5. **Password Cracking**:
   - Offline and online password cracking methods.
   - Tools used include John the Ripper, Hydra, and Hashcat.

6. **Data Collection**:
   - Extracting sensitive data from compromised systems.
   - Methods for analyzing browser credentials, history, and encrypted keys.

## Methodology

The workflow followed during the project includes:

1. **Lab Setup**: Preparing an isolated lab environment with virtual machines.
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying system weaknesses using Nessus.
3. **Exploitation**: Executing attacks using Metasploit and manual methods.
4. **Post-Exploitation**: Collecting information and ensuring persistence.
5. **Reporting and Analysis**: Documenting findings and reflecting on ethical hacking principles.

## Key Features

1. **Step-by-step setup of a hacking lab** for penetration testing.
2. **Real-world demonstrations** of vulnerability scanning and exploitation.
3. **Comprehensive exploration of Metasploit modules** and their capabilities.
4. **Post-exploitation techniques** to gather sensitive data and maintain access.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up the Lab**:
   - Follow the steps in "Setting Up the Laboratory" to create your virtualized environment.

2. **Run Vulnerability Scans**:
   - Install and configure Nessus on Kali Linux.
   - Conduct scans on Metasploitable and Windows machines.

3. **Perform Exploitation**:
   - Use Metasploit's `msfconsole` for launching exploits against identified vulnerabilities.

4. **Execute Post-Exploitation Tasks**:
   - Utilize Meterpreter sessions for advanced features such as hash dumping and process injection.

5. **Analyze Results**:
   - Document and analyze the vulnerabilities exploited and the data collected.
